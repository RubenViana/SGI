## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- (items briefly describing main strong points)
- Scene
  - In our interactive graphics systems project, we have created a room with various elements. On one wall, there are shelves, a fireplace with a carocha (a type of car) mounted above it. On another wall, we've placed a window that provides a view of a pool, and in the corner, there's a Snorlax character. On a different wall, there are three picture frames featuring images of ourselves. In the center frame, we've placed a picture of Cristiano Ronaldo, the famous footballer, and in the opposite corner, there's a vase with a flower. Yet another wall features sound columns and a TV where we can watch "Preço Certo," a TV show. In the center of the room, there's a table surrounded by eight chairs. On the table, you'll find a cake with a lit candle, a journal as per the request, and a spring. To capture all of this, we've set up a camera with the various objects as targets, and we've implemented shadows as requested. We've made every effort to adhere to all the specified requirements, and this is the ultimate outcome or final result of our work.

### [TP2 - Development of a 3D graphics application](tp2)
- (items briefly describing main strong points)
- Scene
  - In our interactive graphics systems project, we've designed an indoor table tennis tournament environment. It includes various elements such as benches for seating, a table tennis table at the center, two robotic players engaged in the game, two rackets, a ball, and an advertising screen encircling the table (displaying a video). Additionally, we've integrated two trees to capture the festive Christmas spirit, one of them specifically included to showcase the effectiveness of LODs (Level of Detail). The scene incorporates a painting that effectively demonstrates the application of mipmaps. Furthermore, there are four polygons serving as pavilion lights on the side walls, featuring a textured brick surface (bump-map textures). Lastly, we've installed a scoreboard on the wall to keep track of the game's progress and scores.
  - Additionally, our GUI includes a toggle button that enables us to switch between displaying wireframe and solid textures. We've incorporated additional cameras to present various perspectives of the scene.
